Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the index.js code 

```javascript
const express = require("express");
```
1. This line imports the Express module, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. This library is needed to create and configure the web server.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
```
2. This line imports the `fs` (File System) module, a core Node.js module that allows reading and writing files. Itâ€™s used here to read files based on incoming requests.

```javascript
const app = express();
```
3. Here, we create an instance of the Express application by calling `express()`. This `app` object provides methods for handling HTTP requests.

```javascript
app.get("/files/:fileNam", function (req, res) {
    const flnm = req.params.fileNam;
    console.log(flnm);
    fs.readFile(flnm, "utf-8", function (err, data) {
        res.json({
            data
        });
    });
});
```
4. This section defines a GET route handler for requests with the path `/files/:fileNam`. The `:fileNam` portion is a route parameter, meaning it can be any file name that users specify. The request handler:
   - Extracts the file name from `req.params.fileNam` and assigns it to the `flnm` variable.
   - Logs the file name to the console.
   - Uses `fs.readFile()` to asynchronously read the content of the specified file. The arguments are:
     - `flnm`: the file name.
     - `"utf-8"`: the encoding format.
     - A callback function that receives `err` and `data`.
   - If the read operation is successful, it sends a JSON response containing the file data.

```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```
5. Finally, the app listens on port 3000, making it accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Any requests sent to this server, such as `http://localhost:3000/files/test.txt`, will be handled by the specified route.
